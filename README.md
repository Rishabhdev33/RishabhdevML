# Machine Learning Workshop

This repository contains files for the machine learning workshop exercises tied to the course. Each exercise focuses on a specific machine learning method or algorithm, implemented in Python with various libraries.

## Workshop Overview

### Exercise 1: Cost Function
- **Aim**: Develop the cost function for a fundamental linear regression model.
- **Description**: This exercise introduces the concept of the cost function, emphasizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) and illustrating its importance in evaluating model effectiveness.

### Exercise 2: Linear Regression
- **Aim**: Construct a linear regression model from scratch.
- **Description**: This exercise covers the essentials of linear regression, including hypothesis functions, gradient descent, and the process of determining model parameters.

### Exercise 3: Logistic Regression & Multiclass Logistic Regression
- **Aim**: Implement logistic regression for binary classification and extend it to multiple classes using a one-vs-all approach.
- **Description**: 
  - **Part 1**: Create a binary logistic regression model.
  - **Part 2**: Implement multiclass logistic regression utilizing the one-vs-all strategy.

### Exercise 4: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Aim**: Implement SVM for both regression and classification tasks.
- **Description**: 
  - **Part 1**: Develop Support Vector Regression (SVR).
  - **Part 2**: Create Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and non-linear kernels.

### Exercise 5: Decision Tree
- **Aim**: Build a Decision Tree for classification tasks.
- **Description**: This exercise demonstrates the application of decision trees, covering model creation, tree pruning, and performance evaluation on different datasets.
